TBackgroundModel compiles on Linux but not on Mac, currently there's a bug on ROOT version 6.XX where the code compiles but crashes when it runs (problem doesnt happen on Linux), there's also a bug on ROOT version 5.34 where the code cannot compile on Mac ("Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64").
